### Main view
- Create a main page that displays a grid list of cities (each city is displayed as a square)
- Only display **active** cities to the user
- Implement a **search** functionality that allows the user to **filter** cities by name or country **using a single search field**
- Implement a filter functionality that allows the user to filter cities by continent
- Implement a **sorting** functionality that allows the user to sort cities by name or distance to a specified location (e.g., Tel Aviv)
- When the search term yields zero results, display a *No results found* message to the user
- Allow the user to configure the temperature units to either international or imperial
- Each city square should display the following information: City name, Country name, Description, Background image

#### City details page (Weather)
- Allow the user to view the details of a selected city, including the weather status (temperature, weather status, etc.)
- The temperature data should be displayed in the selected units by the user
- Provide a back button that takes the user back to the main page. The applied filters should be preserved upon returning to the main page.

You can retrieve the weather data from `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall?lon=[lon]&lat=[lat]&units=metric&appid=[api-key]` or any other data source of your choice.
